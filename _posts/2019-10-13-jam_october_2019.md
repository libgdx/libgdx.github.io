In a delightful turn of events, our regular [libGDX Jam](https://itch.io/jam/libgdx-jam-october-2019) schedule coincides with Halloween. In the spirit of the holiday, we have determined that we will announce the theme early. All jam entries must relate to Halloween in some way. Otherwise, the theme is yours to play with. There will be no theme voting this time!

Be sure to get involved with the community by joining the libGDX Discord server!
