Since our last release a little over a year ago, a great deal of work has been done! libGDX 1.11.0 brings improvements and new features in various areas â€“ take a look below to find out more! If you are upgrading from an older version, be sure to also check out the [Ultimate Migration Guide (1.9.10 to 1.10.0)](/news/2021/04/the-ultimate-migration-guide).

### LWJGL 3!
As announced in [Status Report #7](/news/2021/07/devlog-7-lwjgl3), the LWJGL 3 backend is now the default desktop backend. This ensures continued support for newer hardware and JVMs and includes a few other nifty features. Check out the Status Report to see how to [update your projects](/news/2021/07/devlog-7-lwjgl3#how-can-i-migrate), if you haven't already! We also updated from LWJGL 3.2.3 to [3.3.1](https://github.com/LWJGL/lwjgl3/releases/tag/3.3.1), which adds the long awaited **M1 Mac support**!

Another cool new feature is the **`gdx-lwjgl3-glfw-awt-macos` extension**. If you add it as a dependency to your desktop project, LWJGL 3/libGDX must no longer run on the main thread in macOS, which allows AWT to work in parallel, i.e. file dialogs, JFrames, ImageIO, etc. can be used. Moreover, you no longer need to pass the `-XstartOnFirstThread` argument when starting a LWJGL 3 app on macOS. See `AwtTestLWJGL` in gdx-tests-lwjgl3 for an example. For more information, take a look at [#6772](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/pull/6772).

In addition, legacy LWJGL 3 projects must update their `sourceCompatibility` to `1.8` or higher! Otherwise an error similar to the one below will appear:
```bash
Execution failed for task ':desktop:compileJava'.
> Could not resolve all files for configuration ':desktop:compileClasspath'.
   > Could not resolve com.badlogicgames.gdx:gdx-backend-lwjgl3:1.11.0.
     Required by:
         project :desktop
      > No matching variant of com.badlogicgames.gdx:gdx-backend-lwjgl3:1.11.0 was found. The consumer was configured to find an API of a library compatible with Java 7, preferably in the form of class files, and its dependencies declared externally but:
          - Variant 'apiElements' capability com.badlogicgames.gdx:gdx-backend-lwjgl3:1.11.0 declares an API of a library, packaged as a jar, and its dependencies declared externally:
              - Incompatible because this component declares a component compatible with Java 8 and the consumer needed a component compatible with Java 7
      [...]
```

Furthermore:
- Please note that `Lwjgl3ApplicationConfiguration#useOpenGL3` was replaced by `#setOpenGLEmulation`.
- `LWJGL3Net#openURI` does now work on macOS & JDK >= 16; we also added a fallback to `xdg-open` on Linux if `Desktop.BROWSE` is unavailable
- Issues with LWJGL 3 and borderless fullscreen were resolved
- The `AL_DIRECT_CHANNELS_SOFT` option is now enabled by default for Sounds and AudioDevices as well; see [#6527](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/pull/6527)

### LWJGL 3 ANGLE Extension
[Mario](https://twitter.com/badlogicgames) also recently added a LWJGL3 [ANGLE](https://github.com/google/angle) extension. It emulates OpenGL ES 2.0 through DirectX (Windows), desktop OpenGL (Linux), and Metal (macOS) and may become the preferred method of rendering on macOS if Apple removes OpenGL support entirely.

To use it, add the `gdx-lwjgl3-angle` extension to your `gdx-lwjgl3` desktop project. Then call `config.setOpenGLEmulation(GLEmulation.ANGLE_GLES20, 0, 0)` on your `Lwjgl3ApplicationConfiguration` instance before creating your `Lwjgl3Application`. Check out [#6672](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/pull/6672) for more information.  

**Pros:**
- Better compatibility with systems that don't support OpenGL 2 by using DirectX on Windows and Metal on macOS.
- May fix some OpenGL driver issues.

**Cons:**
- Does only support OpenGL ES 2.0, as the macOS ANGLE Metal backend [only supports OpenGL ES 2.0](https://github.com/google/angle#level-of-opengl-es-support-via-backing-renderers) at this point in time.
- Currently contains non-working 32-bit Windows natives (see [#6806](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/issues/6806)).
- Doesn't support window transparency on macOS/Linux.

## A few notable changes
- Updated to [MobiVM 2.3.16](https://github.com/MobiVM/robovm/wiki/Changelog#2316-apr-2022) from 2.3.12. This adds iOS 15.4 bindings, native M1 support as well as other fixes and improvements, including Gradle 7 support.
- The GWT reflection cache was split into two generated classes, which doubles its size! ([#6386](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/pull/6386))
- An octree structure was added; see [#6229](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/pull/6229)
- Added `NWSEResize`, `NESWResize`, `AllResize`, `NotAllowed` and `None` system cursors; see [#6756](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/pull/6756) & [#6822](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/pull/6822); and `Graphics#setSystemCursor()` now works on Android as well
- GWT assets can now be hosted on a different URL than the Javascript files themselves ([#6851](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/pull/6851))

### Other breaking changes
- We increased the minimum supported iOS version to 9.0. Update your `Info.plist` file if necessary.
- On Android, we moved the natives loading out of static init block (see [#5795](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/issues/5795)); this allows users to run code before the initialisation of the natives
- Shared libraries are now built on Ubuntu 18.04 (up from Ubuntu 16.04) to match the behaviour of LWJGL 3; this may make older Linux operating systems no longer compatible (see [#6659](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/pull/6659))
- The built-in font files `arial-15.fnt` and `arial-15.png` have been replaced with `lsans-15.fnt` and `lsans-15.png`. The new files should match the old ones very closely, but there is the possibility that it may change some text layout that uses the built-in font. Code that expects arial-15 assets to be present must change to lsans-15! ([#6727](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/pull/6727))
- `AndroidApplicationConfiguration#hideStatusBar` was removed; see [#6683](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/pull/6683)
