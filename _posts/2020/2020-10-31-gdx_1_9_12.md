Today, we are releasing version 1.9.12 of libGDX – and with that a lot of exiting changes. As you may recall, initially, this release was supposed to be called 1.10, but we had some troubles with publishing on maven, so this release is named 1.9.12. However, don't you worry, this changes nothing about the contents of this update!

### Linux ARM Builds
One of the major additions in libGDX 1.9.12 is the support for Linux ARM builds with our LWJGL 3 backend. We already talked about this in our past Status Reports, but [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org) here we are – and we are here to stay! If anyone of you has some cool pictures of libGDX games running on a Raspberry Pi, poke me on Discord - we would very much like to put together a small showcase of the [first console](https://retropie.org.uk) supported by libGDX.

### Breaking changes
Version 1.9.12 contains a few breaking changes, which require the developers to take some steps to update their apps:

- The handling of HDPI, ahem, Retina on iOS was adapted to match the implementations on the other platforms ([#3709](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/pull/3709)). If you were using `getWidth()` until now, you have to replace those calls with `getBackBufferWidth()` (the same for height). If you rely on viewports, there is no need of changes, because sizes are virtual anyway. If you are using `getDensity()` to position your UI elements, take a look [here](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/pull/6263).
- `InputProcessor#scrolled` now receives two (!) float (!) values: `scrollX` and `scrollY` ([#6154](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/pull/6154)). `InputEvent` was changed accordingly. To match the old behaviour use the `amountY` argument.
- `Vector2#angleRad(Vector2)` now correctly returns counter-clockwise angles ([#5428](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/pull/5428)).
- Android: `Gdx.graphics.getDeltaTime()` now returns the raw delta time instead of a smoothed one ([#6228](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/pull/6228)).
- `Gdx.files.external` on Android now uses an app's external storage directory. See this [wiki article](/wiki/file-handling#android) for more information.

### Other notable changes:
- Updated to MobiVM 2.3.11 (which supports the latest Apple devices, but not yet the [iOS 14 bindings](https://dkimitsa.github.io/2020/10/23/robovm-2-3-11-released/))
- As announced in Status Report #1, the iOS MOE backend was removed in favour of the RoboVM one.
- The audio backend on GWT was changed to the WebAudio API ([#5659](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/pull/5659)). This allows for better mobile support and implements pitch. The `preferFlash` config option was removed. When updating existing projects, you can remove the soundmanager JS files from your _webapp_ folder and the references to it from _index.html_.
- The GWT backend now supports resizable applications via the use of `GwtApplicationConfiguration`. The old resizing code from your HTMLLaunchers can be removed.
- There is now also the possibility to lazy load assets via AssetManager instead of preloading them before game start. See [here](/wiki/HTML5-Backend-and-GWT-Specifics#speeding-up-preload-process) for more information.
- We added a `Lwjgl3ApplicationConfiguration#foregroundFPS` option to the LWJGL3 backend to match the behaviour of the old LWJGL2 backend. This can be used to set a target framerate for games on desktop.
- If you are having trouble playing several sounds simultaneously on Android, you can try the new `AsynchronousAndroidAudio` implementation ([#6243](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/pull/6243)).

**Known issues:** At the moment, Box2D collision filtering is working unreliably with libGDX 1.9.12. This is [fixed](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/pull/6261) in [libGDX 1.9.13](/news/2021/01/gdx_1_9_13).

### Future plans?
Just to give you all a quick outlook on what we're planning for the next weeks:
- **gdx-controller version 2.0.0** is done and will be released shortly.
- **Status Report #4** will focus on our new web-based setup tool and will be published in the next couple of weeks, as soon as our setup tool is ready for public testing.
- As mentioned in Status Report #3, our **next libGDX release** is set for the end of the year.
- **gdx-video** and the **Box2D update** are still being worked on.

```
- [BREAKING CHANGE] iOS: Changed how Retina/hdpi handled on iOS. See #3709.
- [BREAKING CHANGE] API Change: InputProcessor scrolled method now receives scroll amount for X and Y. Changed type to float to support devices which report fractional scroll amounts. Updated InputEvent in scene2d accordingly: added scrollAmountX, scrollAmountY attributes and corresponding setters and getters. See #6154.
- [BREAKING CHANGE] API Change: Vector2 angleRad(Vector2) now correctly returns counter-clockwise angles. See #5428
- [BREAKING CHANGE] Android: getDeltaTime() now returns the raw delta time instead of a smoothed one. See #6228.
- [BREAKING CHANGE] Gdx.files.external on Android now uses app external storage - see wiki article File handling for more information
