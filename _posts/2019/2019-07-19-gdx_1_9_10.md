libGDX version 1.9.10 has been released!

![](/assets/images/posts/2019-07-19/version.png)

### A few notable changes:

- GWT update to 2.8.2
- MobiVM release 2.3.7
- LWJGL 3.2.1
- Lots of QOL and bug fixes for GWT backend
- Better iOS backend customization
- PixmapPacker features like NinePatch and whitespace stripping
- InstancedRendering support via Mesh and InstanceBufferObjects
- SCENE2D (Standard tweaks and improvements across the board)
- Gradle updates to latest
- Long overdue Gradle upgrade to 5.4 for new projects, now that the major IDEs are playing slightly nicer with our multi-project setup. For changes you need to have for your own existing projects, see the build script resources [here](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/tree/master/extensions/gdx-setup/res/com/badlogic/gdx/setup/resources).

### Full changelog
```
- API Addition: Allow target display for maximization LWJGL3 backend
- API Addition: Accelerometer support on GWT
- API Change: Set default behaviour of iOS audio to allow use of iPod
- API Change: IOSDevice is no longer an enum to allow users to add their own new devices when libGDX is not up to date
- API Addition: Add statusBarVisible configuration to IOSApplicationConfiguration
- Update GWT Backend to GWT 2.8.2
- Update Android backend to build against API 28 (Android 9.0)
- API Addition: Input.isButtonJustPressed
- Update to LWJGL 2 backend to 2.9.3
- Update to MobiVM 2.3.6 release
- Update to LWJGL 3.2.1
- API Addition: Input allows getting the maximum number of pointers supported by the backend
- API Addition: Configuration option added to allow setting a max number of threads to use for net requests
- API Change: NetJavaImpl now uses a cached thread pool to allow concurrent requests (by default, the thread pool is unbounded - use maxNetThreads in backend configurations to set a limit - set to 1 for previous behavior)
- API Addition: New MathUtils norm and map methods
- API Change: Pixmap blending was incorrect. Generated fonts may change for the better, but may require adjusting font settings.
- API Change: Particle effects obtained from a ParticleEffectPool are now automatically started
- Removed OSX 32-bit support
- API Change: By default LWJGL2 backend no longer does pause/resume when becoming background/foreground window. New app config setting was added to enable the old behavior.
- API Change: By default LWJGL2 backend now does pause/resume when window is minimized/restored. New app config setting was added to disable this behavior.
- LWJGL3: Fixed window creation ignoring refresh rate of fullscreen mode.
- TmxMapLoader and AtlasTmxMapLoader refactoring: Shared functionality was moved to BaseTmxMapLoader, duplicate code was removed.
- AtlasTmxMapLoader supports group layers now (a positive side effect of the BaseTmxMapLoader refactoring).
- API Change: TmxMapLoader and AtlasTmxMapLoader: load/loadAsync methods work exactly as before, but many methods of these classes had to change. This makes it possible implement new Tiled features.
- API Addition: TextField#drawMessageText.
- Fixed TextField rendering text outside the widget at small sizes.
- API Addition: Group#getChild(int)
- API Addition: notEmpty() for collections.
- API Change: scene2d.ui Tree methods renamed for node set/getObject to set/getValue.
- API Change: scene2d.ui Tree and Tree.Node require generics for the type of node, values, and actors.
- API Change: For Selection in scene2d.utils "toggle" is now respected when !required and selected.size == 1.
- API Addition: new InstanceBufferObject and InstanceBufferObjectSubData classes to enable instanced rendering.
- API Addition: Support for InstancedRendering via Mesh
- API Change: Cell#setLayout renamed to setTable.
- API Addition: Added Collections#allocateIterators. When true, iterators are allocated. When false (default), iterators cannot be used nested.
