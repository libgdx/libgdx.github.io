With our 29th collaboration, the [libGDX Jam](/community/jams/) continues the time-honoured tradition of making awesome games using the best framework out there. We encourage camaraderie, teamwork, and good sportsmanship with a side of well-intentioned buffoonery. The general jam rules can as always be found [here](/community/jams/#rules). **To participate take a look at the official [itch.io page of the jam](https://itch.io/jam/libgdx-jam-29).** The humorous jam trailer can be found on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA8s-PtDgKM).

Be sure to get involved with the community by joining the libGDX Discord server!

What’s an Easter egg madness jam without Easter eggs?!?! Here’s the list of eggs that you can put in your game:

- A scythe
- A rainbow
- The word “cake” in the background
- A black cat
- Something biting something else

Put one or put them all, the choice is yours! Happy jamming!
