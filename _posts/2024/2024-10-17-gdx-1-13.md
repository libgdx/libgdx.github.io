It has been some time since our last release, but version 1.13.0 of libGDX brings plenty of improvements and bug fixes. Check out the full list below to find out more.

## Breaking changes

The following changes require you to adapt your existing libGDX codebases:

- [ANDROID] The minimum API level is now `19` (Android 4.4).
- [ANDROID] Removed `Input#setCatchBackKey`, `#isCatchBackKey`, `#setCatchMenuKey`, and `#isCatchMenuKey` deprecated in 1.9.10. Use `#setCatchKey` and `#isCatchKey` instead.
- [ANDROID & iOS] Exceptions occurring in `Runnable` tasks scheduled through `Gdx.app.postRunnable(...)` are no longer swallowed and will crash the app. Add a protection to your tasks if required.
- [GWT] Updated to [GWT 2.11.0](https://www.gwtproject.org/release-notes.html#Release_Notes_2_11_0) from 2.10.0. This improves the JRE emulation to support features from Java 11 like collections, streams, and more. To keep old projects working, add `com.google.jsinterop:jsinterop-annotations:2.0.2:sources` as dependency to your html subproject.
- [iOS] The minimum supported iOS version is now 12.0. Update your `Info.plist` file if necessary.
- [LWJGL3] The `gdx-lwjgl3-glfw-awt-macos` extension was retired. Just remove it from your dependencies and use the following snippet at the start of your `main()` method instead ([#7361](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/pull/7361)):
   ```java
   if (SharedLibraryLoader.isMac) {
       Configuration.GLFW_LIBRARY_NAME.set("glfw_async");
   }
   ```

## A few notable changes
In addition, there are a couple notable changes:

- [CORE] There have been a couple of minor performance improvements, in particular to `Sprite` and `SpriteBatch`.
- [CORE] Added Framebuffer multisample support ([#7185](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/pull/7185)). Take a look at [`GL31FrameBufferMultisampleTest`](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/blob/master/tests/gdx-tests/src/com/badlogic/gdx/tests/gles31/GL31FrameBufferMultisampleTest.java) for a simple example of how to use it.
- [CORE] There is a new API to get user input via native text fields ([#7004](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/pull/7004)).
- [GWT] The audio device can be switched now ([#7243](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/pull/7243)). This has to be enabled via `GwtApplicationConfiguration#fetchAvailableOutputDevices` beforehand.
- [iOS] Updated to [MobiVM 2.3.21](https://github.com/MobiVM/robovm/wiki/Changelog#2321-february-2024) from 2.3.21.
- [iOS] The iOS backend now has an implementaion for `AudioDevice` ([#7371](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/pull/7371)). It can be configured through `IOSApplicationConfiguration` with `audioDeviceBufferSize` and `audioDeviceBufferCount`.
- [LWJGL3] Added the `Lwjgl3ApplicationConfiguration#pauseWhenMinimized` and `#pauseWhenLostFocus` flags to control when the application should call the `pause()` method on the `ApplicationListener` ([#7287](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/pull/7287)).
- [LWJGL3] Support for Linux RISC-V has been added ([#7275](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/pull/7275)).
