Gdx-Liftoff has replaced gdx-setup as the new official setup tool! Available [here](https://github.com/libgdx/gdx-liftoff/releases/latest). You have a choice of languages you can add. TeaVM is available to allow Kotlin web apps. You can choose from several templates, including some meant for Kotlin apps, and one template is a playable sample (Super Koalio). Many third-party extensions are readily available. Folders are structured differently, but are easier to add unit tests to, if you want. It's `lwjgl3`, not `desktop`, now, because it uses LWJGL3. LWJGL2 is also available if you need it. Raeleus made a [video about it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VF6N_X_oWr0). Hooray!
