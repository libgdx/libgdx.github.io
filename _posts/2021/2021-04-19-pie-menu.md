[PieMenu](https://github.com/payne911/PieMenu/) is a library which aims at providing Scene2D users with a circular `WidgetGroup`.

The `RadialGroup` class is a simple container that places its children `Actors` in a circular fashion.

The `PieMenu` class wraps a `RadialGroup` with a bunch of functionalities that allow assigning callback functions to listeners on the highlight and selection of items within the Group.

_In terms of User Interface and User Experience, circular context menus "are faster and more reliable to select from than linear menus, because selection depends on direction instead of distance" ([Wikipedia source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pie_menu#Comparison_with_other_interaction_techniques)). If you enjoy nerdy stuff, you might be interested in reading a bit about [Fitts's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fitts%27s_law#Implications_for_UI_design) since it is what backs up this claim._

### Online demo
If you are not entirely sold on the idea just yet, you can try out the [online demo](https://payne911.github.io/PieMenu/) I've set up just for you. It should allow you to quickly get a feel of what you'd be getting yourself into.

![](/assets/images/posts/2021-04-19/website_demo.gif){: .align-center}

### Usage
At its most basic form, the minimal code you'll need for a PieMenu will look like:

```java
/* Setting up and creating the widget. */
PieMenu.PieMenuStyle style = new PieMenu.PieMenuStyle();
style.sliceColor = new Color(.33f,.33f,.33f,1); // "style" variables affect the way the widget looks
PieMenu menu = new PieMenu(skin.getRegion("white"), style, 80); // "white" would be a 1x1 white pixel

/* Adding a listener. */
menu.addListener(new ChangeListener() {
    @Override
    public void changed(ChangeEvent event, Actor actor) {
        System.out.println("The selected index is: " + menu.getSelectedIndex());
    }
});

/* Populating the widget. */
final int PIE_SLICES = 8;
for (int i = 0; i < PIE_SLICES; i++) {
    Label label = new Label(Integer.toString(i), skin);
    menu.addActor(label);
}

/* Including the Widget in the Stage. */
stage.addActor(menu);
```

#### Documentation
The library is very well documented: it provides extensive JavaDoc, along with a detailed [Wiki](https://github.com/payne911/PieMenu/wiki).

Some of the key articles you might be interested in reading are:
* [How to import the library](https://github.com/payne911/PieMenu/wiki/Integrating-this-library).
* [Complete examples of code](https://github.com/payne911/PieMenu/wiki/Examples), along with textual descriptions of the expected behavior.
* [Understanding how to customize](https://github.com/payne911/PieMenu/wiki/Customizing-the-widget) your widget's look and behavior.

### Examples
Time to show off some GIFs!

#### Games
I am aware of at least 3 games which are currently being developed and have decided to use PieMenu. Here are two recordings that were kindly provided to me by the developers:

#### Use-cases
There is a great amount of flexibility that comes with the library. This slideshow displays a few use-cases in action:

<div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
      {% include carousel.html elements=page.carousel_elements height="50" unit="%" duration="7" control_color="#373737" %}
</div>

_More examples, along with sample code and descriptions, can be found in [PieMenu's wiki](https://github.com/payne911/PieMenu/wiki/Examples)._

#### Animated menus
When it comes to animated menus, you can get some pretty spicy stuff going on:

There is [a whole section of the Wiki](https://github.com/payne911/PieMenu/wiki/Animated-widget) dedicated to those.

### Development Status
PieMenu is mature enough to be considered as a production-ready library.

I do not actively work toward supporting more features anymore, but I am still maintaining it so if you ever find a bug please do create an [Issue](https://github.com/payne911/PieMenu/issues).

If you are interested in contributing to the project, feel free to visit [the Wiki page dedicated to that](https://github.com/payne911/PieMenu/wiki/Contributing).
