							About libgdxjam.com
						</h2>
						<p style="max-width: 870px; display: inline-block; text-align:left;">
							From 2018 to 2019, libgdxjam.com was <i>the</i> platform for libGDX game jams. It
							provided a lot of cool features (theme voting, submissions, etc.) and was used
							for hosting seven (!) of our beloved libGDX game jams. For that, our sincerest
							thanks to the two people that made all of that possible:
							<a href="https://github.com/bigbass1997/">Bigbass</a> and
							<a href="https://github.com/tecksup">tecksup</a>!
							<br><br>
							With the rising popularity and convenience of itch.io's game jam feature, in late
							2019 the libGDX community decided to switch platforms and starting with our August 2019
							jam libgdxjam.com became a relic of the past.
							When in early 2021 Bigbass and tecksup decided to shut down their site, that was only
							the logical consequence. However, as to not let all of the submissions to those seven jams in
							the years 2018 to 2019 vanish, we were more than happy to preserve those submissions
							in an archived version of libgdxjam.com.
							<br><br>
							<b>If you are interested in our upcoming libGDX game jams, be sure to check out our
							current <a href="/community/jams/">website</a>!</b>
