title: The life cycle
---
A libGDX application has a well defined life-cycle, governing the states of an application, like creating, pausing and resuming, rendering and disposing the application.

## ApplicationListener
An application developer hooks into these life-cycle events by implementing the [ApplicationListener](https://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/ci/nightlies/docs/api/com/badlogic/gdx/ApplicationListener.html) interface and passing an instance of that implementation to the `Application` implementation of a specific back-end (see [The Application Framework](/wiki/app/the-application-framework)). From there on, the `Application` will call the `ApplicationListener` every time an application level event occurs. A bare-bones `ApplicationListener` implementation may look like this:

```java
public class MyGame implements ApplicationListener {
   public void create () {
   }

   public void render () {        
   }

   public void resize (int width, int height) { 
   }

   public void pause () { 
   }

   public void resume () {
   }

   public void dispose () { 
   }
}
```

One can also derive from the [ApplicationAdapter](https://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/ci/nightlies/docs/api/com/badlogic/gdx/ApplicationAdapter.html) class if not all interface methods are of relevance.

Once passed to the `Application`, the `ApplicationListener` methods will be called as follows:

| Method signature | Description |
| ---------------- | ----------- |
| `create ()` | Method called once when the application is created.|
| `resize (int width, int height)` | This method is called every time the game screen is re-sized and the game is not in the paused state. It is also called once just after the `create()` method.<br/> The parameters are the new width and height the screen has been resized to in pixels.|
| `render ()` | Method called by the game loop from the application every time rendering should be performed. Game logic updates are usually also performed in this method.|
| `pause ()` | On Android this method is called when the Home button is pressed or an incoming call is received. On desktop this is called when the window is minimized and just before `dispose()` when exiting the application.<br/> A good place to save the game state.|
| `resume ()` | This method is called on Android, when the application resumes from a paused state, and on desktop when unminimized.|
| `dispose ()` | Called when the application is destroyed. It is preceded by a call to `pause()`.|

The following diagram illustrates the life-cycle visually:

## Where is the main loop? ##
libGDX is event driven by nature, mostly due to the way Android and Javascript work. An explicit main loop does not exist, however, the `ApplicationListener.render()` method can be regarded as the body of such a main loop.
