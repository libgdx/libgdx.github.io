The [Bullet physics library](http://bulletphysics.org/wordpress/) extension is a Java wrapper for the C++ engine. It is generated by the interface compiler called [SWIG](http://www.swig.org/).

### Modifying the wrapper ###
New or modified functionality can be added to the Bullet wrapper by modifying the SWIG interface files in `libgdx/extensions/gdx-bullet/jni/swig`. Consult the SWIG [documentation](http://www.swig.org/Doc1.3/Java.html) for details.

[Bullet wrapper custom classes](/wiki/extensions/physics/bullet/bullet-wrapper-custom-classes) which add extra functionality should be put into `libgdx/extensions/gdx-bullet/jni/src/custom`. To use the new classes in Java, include them in the SWIG interface files.

### Building the Java module ###
After the SWIG interface files have been modified, build the gdx-bullet Java module.
```
cd libgdx/extensions/gdx-bullet/jni/swig
ant -f build.xml
```
This will generate Java classes from the Bullet source in `libgdx/extensions/gdx-bullet/jni/src`, using the SWIG interface files.

If a new C++ source file was added, it is necessary to update the `Android.mk` build file before compiling the native Bullet code. This is done by running the Java program `libgdx/extensions/gdx-bullet/src/com/badlogic/gdx/physics/bullet/BulletBuild.java` using the working directory `libgdx/extensions/gdx-bullet`.

### Compiling the native Bullet libraries ###
After the SWIG module has been built, the native libraries for the different architectures can be compiled.
```
cd libgdx/extensions/gdx-bullet/jni
ant -f build.xml all
```
In order to check for problems, verbose output can be enabled with the `-v` flag. To compile for Android, the `NDK_HOME` environment variable must be set. If Linux is used to compile, it may be necessary to append the options `-DndkSuffix="" -Denv.NDK_HOME="/opt/android-ndk"`.

The resulting native binaries will be placed into `libgdx/extensions/gdx-bullet/libs`. Note that running `ant -f fetch.xml` in the libGDX root directory will overwrite them.

### Testing on Android ###
Copy the new native libraries into the corresponding Android test paths
```
cp libgdx/extensions/gdx-bullet/libs/armeabi-v7a/* libgdx/tests/gdx-tests-android/libs/armeabi-v7a/
cp libgdx/extensions/gdx-bullet/libs/armeabi/* libgdx/tests/gdx-tests-android/libs/armeabi/
cp libgdx/extensions/gdx-bullet/libs/arm64-v8a/*  libgdx/tests/gdx-tests-android/libs/arm64-v8a
cp libgdx/extensions/gdx-bullet/libs/x86/*  libgdx/tests/gdx-tests-android/libs/x86
cp libgdx/extensions/gdx-bullet/libs/x86_64/*  libgdx/tests/gdx-tests-android/libs/x86_64
```
Then build and run the Android test suite.
```
gradlew tests:gdx-tests-android:installDebug
```
### Testing on Desktop ###
The new native libraries will be automatically used for the desktop test suite, which you can run using the Gradle wrapper script.
```
gradlew tests:gdx-tests-lwjgl
```
