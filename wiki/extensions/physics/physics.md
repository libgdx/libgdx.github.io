# Libraries #

libGDX comes with 2 different Physics libraries. Box2D which is used for 2D physics and also a experimental Bullet Physics wrapper which can be used for 3D physics.

## Documentation ##

[Box2D Documentation](http://box2d.org/documentation/) - Most documentation is compatible with the libGDX implementation but will need some changes from C++ to Java.

[Bullet Wiki](http://bulletphysics.org/mediawiki-1.5.8/index.php/Main_Page) - Documentation for Bullet should be compatible with the Java wrapper of Bullet but will need various syntax and class name changes.
