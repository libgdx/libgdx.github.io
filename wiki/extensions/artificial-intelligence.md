Since libGDX 1.4.1 the [gdx-ai](https://github.com/libgdx/gdx-ai) extension has been moved to a separate repository under the libGDX umbrella. This allows us to have independent life-cycles. Besides offering some benefits in terms of project maintenance and visibility, this means that from now on the two projects will have distinct version numbers.

Please, refer to the [official gdx-ai wiki](https://github.com/libgdx/gdx-ai/wiki).

Have fun designing intelligent agents!!! :video_game:
