## Scene Composer
Later versions of Skin Composer also include a **[Scene Composer](https://github.com/raeleus/skin-composer/wiki/Scene-Composer)**, a WYSIWYG editor that can export JSON or Java files to be loaded directly in-game. It allows easily prototype Scene2D layouts and seeing your Skin in action.
