# Tutorials

After you have [created](/wiki/start/setup/) your very first libGDX project, we highly recommend our [A Simple Game](/wiki/start/simple-game/) and [Extending the Simple Game](/wiki/start/simple-game-extended/) pages. If you're completely new to game dev and have never developed a game before, this (even more straight-forward) [tutorial](https://colourtann.github.io/HelloLibgdx/) by tann is also worth a look as an alternative.

From then on, our [wiki](/wiki/#developers-guide) is your best companion: it provides extensive documentation on nearly every feature offered by libGDX. For any further questions, our official [Discord server](/community/) is good starting point.

There are also many third-party tutorials. A (non-exhaustive) list of them can be found [here](/wiki/articles/external-tutorials).

# Demos

If you want to inspect some open source libGDX games for reference, this [wiki article](/wiki/articles/external-tutorials#some-simple-open-source-projects-for-reference) is the right place to start looking.

The official libGDX organization on GitHub also offers a few **demo projects** that you can play around with to get a feeling for how to do things. Note that many of these demos have been created during game jams and may not necessarily reflect best practices. To use them [setup your development environment](/wiki/start/setup), then simple clone the repositories on Github (or click on the "Download ZIP" button of a project's site) and import the project into your favorite IDE as a Gradle project.
