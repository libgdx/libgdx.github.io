# Rules
We encourage camaraderie, teamwork, and good sportsmanship with a side of well-intentioned buffoonery. Nonetheless, there are some rules to be followed:

- The game must be created with the libGDX framework.
- The game must be created within the jam period. Late submissions are to be approved by admins.
- Starter projects and templates are permitted, so long as they are not fully fledged games.
- You can work in groups or individually.
- Your game must be based on the selected theme.
- Any and all copyright laws pertaining to assets you use must be followed.
