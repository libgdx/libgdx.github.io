excerpt: "libGDX is a Java game development framework that provides a unified API that works across all supported platforms."

intro:
  - excerpt: 'libGDX is an open-source, cross-platform game development framework built in Java. Unlike many popular editor-based platforms, libGDX is entirely code-centric, offering developers fine-grained control over every aspect of their game. It is the perfect place for exploring ground-up implementations, built on top of lightning-fast OpenGL, and distributable to Desktop, HTML, Android, and iOS.'

    title: "Cross-Platform"
    excerpt: 'libGDX offers a single API to target: **Windows, Linux (including the Raspberry Pi), macOS, Android, iOS and Web**. Developers can use various backends to access the capabilities of the host platform, **without having to write platform-specific code**. Rendering is handled on all platforms through Open GL ES 2.0/3.0.'
feature_row2:
  - image_path: /assets/images/features/reliable.png
    title: "Well proven"
    excerpt: 'The libGDX project was started [over 10 years ago](/history/). Over the years, libGDX and its community matured: nowadays, libGDX is a **[well proven](/showcase/) and reliable framework** with a sound base and documentation. Furthermore, there are plenty of games built on top of libGDX, many of which are open source.'

    title: "Extensive third-party ecosystem"
    excerpt: 'libGDX offers a very extensive third-party ecosystem. There are numerous [tools](/dev/tools/) and libraries that take a lot of work off the hands of developers. [Awesome-libGDX](https://github.com/rafaskb/awesome-libgdx#readme) is a curated list of libGDX-centered **libraries** and a good starting point for anyone new in the libGDX world.'

# Do whatever you want
_Unlike many popular editor-based platforms, libGDX is entirely code-centric, offering developers fine-grained control over every aspect of their game._

- **Freedom:** While libGDX gives you access to various different tools and abstractions, you can still access the underlying base. libGDX acknowledges that there is no one-size-fits-all solution, so it doesn't force you to use certain tools or coding styles: you are free to do whatever you want!
- **Open Source:** libGDX is licensed under Apache 2.0 and maintained by the community, so you can take a look [under the hood](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx) and see how everything works.
- **Java:** Since libGDX uses Java, you can profit from the wide Java ecosystem â€“ Powerful IDEs, out-of-the-box support for Git, fined-tuned debuggers, performance profilers, and an abundance of well-tried libraries and frameworks, as well as many resources and extensive documentation.
