libGDX is being developed lovingly and not for profit by over [300 volunteers](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/graphs/contributors) across the globe. Most of us work on libGDX in our free time. Some can make it part of their day job. But all of us contribute our code under the very permissive Apache 2 license, which means you can use our code in commercial and non-commercial projects without any strings or license fees attached.

Sadly, libGDXâ€™s infrastructure does not yet run on love. Thus, to ensure that libGDX can keep growing at a steady pace, we need your support. Our recurring monthly expenses include the website, hosting space for nightly and release builds, as well as a contribution to the [MobiVM project](https://github.com/MobiVM). The libGDX [core team](https://github.com/orgs/libgdx/people) is hence kindly asking for your financial support to cover these monthly costs. Any excess income will be used to buy licenses as well as development and test devices for core contributors.

If you can't help us out financially that's OK! Give back by contributing code and participating in our community!

Thank you very much, <br/>
The libGDX Team
