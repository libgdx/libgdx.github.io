# How to get started with libGDX?
libGDX offers a [setup tool](/wiki/start/project-generation/), which automatically creates a project and downloads everything necessary.
{: .notice--primary}

To get started, please take a look at our **[Setup Instructions](/wiki/start/setup/)** page, which walks you through the process of creating your very first libGDX project using our setup tool. After that, we highly recommend our **[A Simple Game](/wiki/start/a-simple-game/)** and [Extending the Simple Game](/wiki/start/simple-game-extended/) pages. If you're completely new to game dev and have never developed a game before, this (even more straight-forward) [tutorial](https://colourtann.github.io/HelloLibgdx/) by tann is also worth a look as an alternative.

From then on, our [wiki](/wiki/) is your best companion: it provides extensive documentation on nearly every feature offered by libGDX. For any further questions, our official [Discord server](/community/) is good starting point.

If you want to explore some other (third-party) tutorials or inspect some demos/other open source libGDX games for reference, this [wiki article](/wiki/start/demos-and-tutorials) is the right place to start looking.

<br/>

# Documentation
The libGDX codebase is documented in two ways:
- In our [Wiki](/wiki/)
- And via [Javadocs](https://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/ci/nightlies/docs/api/)

<br/>

# Tools & Libraries
There are different tools and libraries that make the development process for libGDX easier. See our **[Tools List](/dev/tools/)** for some of the most commonly used tools.

A curated list of our favourite libraries can be found at **[Awesome-libGDX](https://github.com/rafaskb/awesome-libgdx#readme)**. On our Discord server we also have an extensive collection of libGDX-centered libraries that are currently work in progress.

<br/>

# Contributing to libGDX
Contributing to libGDX can come in a few different forms: you can [report issues](/dev/issues/), help out on our [Discord](/community/), pledge to the [Patreon page](/funding/), or [submit code and documentation back to the project](/dev/contributing/) on GitHub.

If you want to contribute to the code base of libGDX, please review our [contributing guidelines](/dev/contributing/). After that, you need to get libGDX set up on your local machine. Instructions for that can be found [here](/dev/from_source/).
