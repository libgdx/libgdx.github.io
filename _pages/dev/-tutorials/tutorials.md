# Tutorials

After you have [created](/dev/setup/) your very first libGDX project, we highly recommend our [A Simple Game](/dev/simple_game/) and [Extending the Simple Game](/dev/simple_game_extended/) pages. If you're completely new to game dev and have never developed a game before, this (even more straight-forward) [tutorial](http://tann.space/HelloLibgdx/) by tann is also worth a look as an alternative.

From then on, our [wiki](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/wiki/A-Simple-Game) is you best companion: it provides extensive documentation on nearly every feature offered by libGDX. For any further questions, our official [Discord server](/community/) is good starting point.

# Demos

If you want to inspect some open source libGDX games for reference, this [wiki article](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/wiki/External-tutorials#some-simple-open-source-projects-for-reference) is the right place to start looking.

The official [libGDX organization](https://github.com/libgdx) on GitHub also offers a few demo projects.
